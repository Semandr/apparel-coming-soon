## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Native JavaScript ES6+

### What I learned

It was a great challenge that allowed me to expand my knowledge about the properties of images and the Grid system. The most difficult thing for me was the correct adaptation to both mobile and desktop systems. But, I hope I got it right. You can always and should learn something new.
